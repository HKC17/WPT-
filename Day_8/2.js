let n1 = `Tim David's unbeaten 32 off 19 went in vain as Lucknow Super Giants defeated Mumbai Indians by 5 runs on Tuesday.
With Mumbai needing 11 runs off the final over, Mohsin Khan conceded only five runs.
Earlier, Marcus Stoinis' fiery 89-run knock guided LSG to 177 for 3 in 20 overs. 
Getting an invitation to bat first, LSG were 35 for 3 in 6.1 overs but Stoinis and Krunal Pandya (49) lifted the team with a solid patnership. 
Jason Behrendorff (2 for 30) was pick of the bowlers for MI.`;
